WordChains - chain of words

Introduction
===

This is a working solution for this paticularly problem:
Write a program that solves a word-chain puzzle. The challenge is to build a chain of words, 
starting with one particular word and ending with another. 
Successive entries in the chain must all be real words from the dictionary, 
and each can differ from the previous word by just one letter
For example, you can get from “cat” to “dog” using the following chain.
 
cat - cot - cog - dog
 
The objective of this kata is to write a program that accepts start and end words and, 
using words from the dictionary, builds a word chain between them. 
If possible, return the shortest word chain that solves each puzzle. 
For example, you can turn “lead” into “gold” in four steps (lead - load - goad - gold), 
and “ruby” into “code” in six steps (ruby - rubs - robs - rods - rode - code).


How to run & test WordChains
===

Build Dictionary:
A dictionary is provided already but in case you can to rebuilt the dictionary:
Delete all files which have extension .zip and .db. Run command:

php BuildDictionary.php

Run PHPUnit and test with existing test cases:

php phpunit.phar TestWordChains.php
